        <h1>District Lines</h1>
        <h5><a href="/pages/projects-and-portfolio.html">Back to Projects &amp; Portfolio Companies</a></h5>
        <p>Full-service online store with a focus on musical and YouTube talent. In 2007 I was hired to develop and launch the site, three months after we launched I had signed some of our largest clients at the time and was a shareholder.</p>
        <p>Building and growing District Lines was extremely cool, but the absolute most important part about it was giving creators a way to monetize what they were doing without selling out. Before the YouTube Partner Program had a vast reach and viable payouts District Lines was one of the first ways that YouTubers could earn a living through the support of their viewers.</p>
        <p>Over the next year I developed a vertical that solidified the company's place as the best place for YouTubers to sell merch and doubled our sales 3 times through 2008. In a few years I signed merch deals with hundreds of top talent including <a href="http://twitter.com/RayWJ">Ray William Johnson</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/Jenna_Marblesâ€Ž">Jenna Marbles</a>, <a href="http://mysteryguitarman.com">Mystery Guitar Man</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.smosh.com">Smosh</a>.</p>
        <p>As CIO I developed our direct-to-retail strategy, facilitated the purchase of Smartpunk and signed exclusive merch deals with 4 of the top multi-channel networks (MCNs, or YouTube networks if you are OG YouTube). Two of my favorite creations were the <a href="/projects/district-lines-product-picks.html">District Lines Product Picks</a>, a way for store owners to sell third-party merch items, and the <a href="/projects/district-lines-shirt-network.html">District Lines Shirt Network</a>, an automated first-of-its-kind t-shirt promotional tool to reward brand promoters with free shirts.</p>
