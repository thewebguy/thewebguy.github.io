        <p>Hosted CMS before SaaS was an acronym. I paid most of my bills through college doing freelance programming, mostly for bands that just needed content management that handled news, blog posts, tour dates and usually one or two custom sections. In 2003 WordPress was still brand new and plugins hadn't even been added yet, so everything was custom-built.</p>
        <p>After my 3rd or 4th client needed basically the same thing I decided a single solution should work for about 80% of use cases, so I built The Pantry. Every content section was technically custom, I wasn't really good at saying "no", but development time was cut down by about 80% which let me take up much more work.</p>
        <p>Some highlights are a dozen Billboard charting bands including Gym Class Heroes, Panic at the Disco, Powerman 5000 &amp; Every Time I Die</p>
