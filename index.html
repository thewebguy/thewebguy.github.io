        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Kevin learned HTML in elementary school, then took every programming class he could through high school.</p>
        <p>While freelancing through college Kevin started a nerdy apparel line called <a href="/projects/leetcore.html">Leetcore</a> & sold a few hundred t-shirts. Selling a creative, physical product that people wanted was insanely gratifying.</p>
        <p>To handle his growing freelancing business he built a CMS he called <a href="/projects/the-pantry.html">The Pantry</a> and licensed it to 100+ bands including multi-platinum artists Panic at the Disco.</p>
        <p>Kevin developed print-shop management suite <a href="/projects/runmyshop.html">Run My Shop</a> to help run <a href="/projects/merchspin.html">MerchSpin</a> and developed ecommerce solutions for specialty shops including Johnny Cupcakes and online stores including <a href="/projects/district-lines.html">District Lines</a>.</p>
        <p>After becoming a shareholder District Lines & sister print-shop MerchSpin, Kevin developed merchandising for YouTube creators and signed exclusive merch deals with hundreds of top channels including Smosh & Jenna Marbles and 4 MCNs.</p>
        <p>Kevin got into live events after co-founding an artist management company focused on YouTube talent and made the first ever <a href="/projects/livelavalive-the-dial-up-tour.html">YouTuber tour</a> with CAA, second national youtuber tour with Live Nation.</p>
        <p>In 2010 Kevin co-created & produced <a href="/projects/playlist-live.html">Playlist Live</a>, a 3-day YouTube focused convention, and grew the event to 4,000+ attendees.</p>
        <p>After a successful 2013 event Kevin left to work a number of developing side projects and launched <a href="/projects/channel-totals.html">Channel Totals</a>, a stat totaling webapp for YouTube channels.</p>
        <p>Kevin lives in Orlando, FL with his crafty, design blogger wife <a href="http://sarahhearts.com">Sarah</a>.</p>
